We ordered a kit for the machine and after assembling the machine, we made all the electronics ourselves.
We have been looking for a long time for a convenient set for the machine that will have many useful functions and advantages included in the set.
We also made a model ourselves that protects the HuskyLens camera and also printed the blocks ourselves for our field .
And in electronics, we came up with a solution to the problem of heating wires by taking thicker ones.
And to communicate between HuskyLens and Arduino Nano, we use the UART protocol. And we ourselves came up with the location of 4 sensors.
Our sensors stand at a specific angle of 165 degrees. And the remaining 2 sensors serve for parking. The HuskyLens was secured with posts and nuts.

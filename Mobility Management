## Mobility Management
We use one 12 volt DC motor to move our robot, and a servo motor MG 996R to turn it. The DC motor has a gearbox with a speed ratio of three to one, that is, 1 revolution of the motor rotates the small gear of the wheel 3 times. And the servo is connected to the steering rack, which turns. The DC motor is connected to the motor driver. Also, the low landing of our machine maintains a stable position on the field. The turning angle is also adjusted as in riding a bike. That is, our robot does not leave the range of 90 degrees because when he leaves this range, he stops riding and loses control. This is the same when a person rides a bike and if he turns at a large angle, he will fall and lose control. But we cut out the walls and printed the blocks for the field for the car with corners. Blocks with green and red colors, as well as a parking lot, were printed using a 3D printer and this is how we built our field on which we tested the car.

In this file we want to say about how we started and what you need to know to do that project.
We are saying it because the idea of Future Engineers is to encourage new teams and support them in finding existing solutions and get inspired by them.

1) At first, we were looking for a kit for our car that has everything we need.Any set will do, you can even find a better set than ours.Electronics are the main thing here, but functionality is also important.
2) And after you build the car from the kit, install the arduino board and buy wires with sensors and motors.
3) And after you build the car from the kit, install the arduino board and buy wires with sensors and motors.
4) You can also replace ultrasonic sensors with light sensors.
5) And then go to our sections where the code is and download the Arduino Ide program, copy all the code and connect your device to the Arduino using a conductor.
6) Cut out all the walls for the fields and you can also print the blocks that the machine should pass using the block module in models,in our GitHub.

Now you can repeat our project and try more and more new things and gain experience.
